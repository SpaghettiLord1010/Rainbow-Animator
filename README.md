To the person that might be reading this somewhen in the future:

I want to thank you for choosing my project for reading through. It is an honor to be an example of how "old code" was written, you maybe have fancy new ways to code, but this is what my life is, coding in the 21st century. Please see my code as an idea on how some people might think very different from each other. I think in your time it will still be very important to learn the hard lesson of "Failure is a part of success". Always keep this in mind. Please excuse any spelling mistakes. I really am gratefull that you are viewing this and maybe analysing it or whatever, it fills me with joy, knowing that a part of my life still is relevant in the future - of course I'm speaking about GitHubs project to store all public repositries in the arctic. I want you to know how I felt when coding this, it filled me with joy, learning, experiencing, thinking outside of the box. I want you to have this exact feeling of joy when analysing this code. The thought is an incredible one and I wish you all the best for your future, and the one last thing I want to tell you "Do never, ever discard any idea of yours, only because someone tells you it it stupid or impractical, do whatever you want, in the way you imagined it, make it different, make it simply yours."
Thank you. Phillipp Hutterer 2019
